    The task is to create a chatbot with whom you can spend your time discussing your deepest thoughts with. Create a
    chatbot with an AI that learns from your input. Your bot should inspire you to releave your darkest inner truths.

Rules:

    You can use any programming language.
    Your programs should not take any input from filename, network or anything else but the user input.
    There can be no preset vocabulary, the bot should learn everything it knows from the user input, and the discussion
    can be about anything.

Mandatory criterias:

    This is not Code-golf, but please keep it simple, sourcecode size should correspond to programming language,
    meaning: GolfScript=short, BF=long, other=Use common sense. Use the example code as a reference, your code may be
    double that size, but then it better be good.
    Your program can not start to lag (5-10 seconds delay) within the first 1000 sentences.
    A reasonable discussion should take form within about 20-30 sentences.
    Your algorithm should differ, in logic, from the example code as much as it can.

Optional bonus judging criterias:

    The better bot learning algorithm, the better program.
    No tennis match, i.e conversation does not follow the strict: “user > computer > user”-loop turns.
    Less mimic, bot behaviour is different from user behaviour, separating the perception of the bot attitude from the
    user attitude.
    Sense different changing moods, for example: talkative, taciturn, optimistic, pessimistic.
    A way of saving and loading the "brain", so that you can continue your discussion with your bot another day.

Example code in c++ for inspiration only:

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <sstream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iterator>

using namespace std;
vector<string> words;
vector<int> weight1;
vector<int> weight2;
int oldbw;

int collect(string const& i, int w1, int w2)
{
    istringstream iss(i), iss2(i);
    copy(istream_iterator<string>(iss),
             istream_iterator<string>(),
             back_inserter(words));
    words.insert(words.end(), "\n");
    int a = distance(istream_iterator<string>(iss2), istream_iterator<string>());
    for(int c=0;c<=a;c++) weight1.insert(weight1.end(), w1);
    for(int c=0;c<=a;c++) weight2.insert(weight2.end(), w2);
    return a;
}

void answer(int c)
{
    string op;
    int bs=0,bw=0,cs,si,searchsize,cc, c2;
    cout << "BRAIN: ";

    for(int iwrd = words.size()-c; iwrd >= 0; iwrd--)
    {
        searchsize = words.size()/4;
        cs = 0; si=searchsize;
        for(int iw = words.size()-2; (iw >= 0 && si!=0); iw--)
        {
            cc = iwrd-searchsize+si;
            if (cc>=0) if (words[cc]!="\n" && words[cc]==words[iw]) cs += si*(weight2[cc]-weight1[cc]);
            si--;
        }
        if(cs>=bs && iwrd<(int)words.size()*0.9 && abs(iwrd-oldbw)>((int)words.size()/5))
        {bs=cs; bw = iwrd;}
    }

    oldbw=bw;

    if(bw<0)bw=0;
    for(c2=bw; c2< (int)words.size()-1;c2++) if(words[c2]=="\n") {bw=c2+1;break;}

    for(c2=0;(bw+c2) < (int)words.size();c2++)
        if(words[bw+c2]!="\n") op += words[bw+c2] + " "; else break;

    c2=0;
    while(c>=0)
    {
        if(bw-(++c2)>=0)
        {
            if(weight1[bw-c2]>0) { weight1[bw-c2]--; c--; }
        } else c=-1;

        if(bw+c2>=0)
        {
            if(weight2[bw+c2]>0) { weight2[bw+c2]--; c--; }
        } else c=-1;
    }

    collect(op,3,5);
    cout << op << "\n  YOU: ";
}

int main() {
    string i;
    oldbw=0;
    do { getline(cin, i); answer(collect(i,5,3)+1);} while(i.compare("exit")!=0);
    return 0;
}

Sample dialog:

Hello there, crazy bot!
BRAIN: Hello there, crazy bot!
  YOU: I am not a crazy bot, I am pure human (and some cheese).
BRAIN: I am not a crazy bot, I am pure human (and some cheese).
  YOU: What cheese are you?
BRAIN: I am not a crazy bot, I am pure human (and some cheese).
  YOU: You did tell me that already.
BRAIN: You did tell me that already.
  YOU: I did not, stop bugging me, you crazy bot!
BRAIN: I am not a crazy bot, I am pure human (and some cheese).
  YOU: Are you a human? How come?
BRAIN: You did tell me that already.
  YOU: I will hunt you down the longests roads
BRAIN: What cheese are you?
  YOU: I am a pink cheese, with some butter. That makes sense to me.
BRAIN: You did tell me that already.
  YOU: Stop telling me that, who are you?
BRAIN: What cheese are you?
  YOU: I tell you what cheese I am if you tell me your name!
BRAIN: What cheese are you?
  YOU: Oh my god! This is leading towards nowhere.
BRAIN: What cheese are you?
  YOU: Oh no, my head hurts. Are you a crazy bot or not?
BRAIN: Are you a human? How come?
  YOU: That is enough! Can we talk about something more funny?
BRAIN: Oh no, my head hurts. Are you a crazy bot or not?
  YOU: I am HUMAN!
BRAIN: What cheese are you?
  YOU:
