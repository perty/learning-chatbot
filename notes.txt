Can be used as an refactoring exercise.

How can we can deterministic tests when there is a random generator in play?

What would a refactor plan look like?

There many maps, collections and manipulations of those. How could we make this more readable by good abstractions?

There first thing is to take out the classes, is that safe?

Many issues in the code, like duplication. How would you approach those?
